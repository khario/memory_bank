      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
         The startup <a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/how-to-master-the-art-of-to-do-lists/" alt="source">iDoneThis</a>
         once found that 41% of to-do list items are never completed. Wouldn't
         it be great if there was a to-do list application that helped you to
         remember the items on your lists, so that you actually made some headway
         with <i>getting things done</i>?
      </p>
      <p>
         Enter <b>memoryBank</b>â€“a to-do list application that actually works.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>memoryBank</b> has been design with simplicity in mind, so that you
         can focus on <i>doing</i> instead of just making lists. You can have
         as many lists as you need, with as many items as you want.
      </p>
      <p>
         All items on your lists have due dates, to help you prioritise your
         workload. Regularly recurring items can be saved to a virtual <i>bank</i>,
         to help you remember to include them in future iterations.
      </p>
      <p>
         You can create simple, text-only lists, or include more complex media
         with our new <b>enhanced list</b> feature.
      </p>
